# Classification-of-Hand-Drawn-Digits-With-Neural-Networks
Classifying the MNIST Data Set In a Neural Network

In this assignment, you will define a new class named `NeuralNetworkClassifier` that extends the `NeuralNetwork` class provided here and is the solution to Assignment A2.  You will use `NeuralNetworkClassifier` to train a classifier of hand-drawn digits.

You will also define the function `confusion_matrix`.
